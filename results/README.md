The jury had a really hard time to pick 5 submissions out of the excellent solutions we received.
At the final round on [March 8th in Stuttgart](http://btw2017.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/?pageId=InformatiCup&language=de), the finalist all gave a presentation of their approach.
All presentations have been :sparkles:, but we had to come up with a ranking so here we go:
